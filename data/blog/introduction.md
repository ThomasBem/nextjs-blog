My name is Thomas Bembridge and this is my first real attempt at blogging!

<img src="/static/images/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar" width="400" />
I will be writing about software development topics that i am:

- passionate about
- interested in
- working on

Hopefully a mix of all the things above!

Some of the topics will be based on experience gained through the my daily job at FMC Technologies where i work as a developer. Other things might be from work i do on the side or just things i'm learning about or experimenting with for fun.

I'm looking forward to writing down and sharing knowledge and experience with with you guys. Hopefully the topics will start up conversations that we all can learn and improve from.
